# Jobs

Tucson and Pima County does not need to be the next Silicon Valley, or Austin TX to succeed. But Tucson needs to heavily invest in itself if we hope to attract new employers with high paying jobs to the area.

Employers consistently ask for the same things:

* Solid Transportation Infrastructure - Roads and Rail/Air Hubs
* An educated workforce - The jobs of tomorrow are highly skilled technical jobs or those in the creative class. We must invest in out higher education system to produce more, and more qualofued graduates
*  

# The jobs will come, if we do...

* The roads in and around Pima county and much of the non maricopa portions of the state are in terrible shape.
